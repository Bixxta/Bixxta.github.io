    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    <p class="lead">This website will be a repository for my work term reports submitted for my Co-Ops at the University of Guelph.</p>
    <h2>Work Terms 1 & 2</h2>
    <h1>The Co-Operators Insurance and Financial Services</h1>
    <img src="../assets/cooperatorslogo.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p class="lead">The Co-operators is a Canadian insurance company based in Guelph, Ontario and with offices nationwide.<br>A co-operative, the Co-operators have consistently been rated one of Canada's top corporate citizens and one of the best places to work.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Job Description</h3>
    <p class="lead">I worked as a junior software engineer at The Co-operators, working on our new Salesforce CRM project. Our team, which was newly founded shortly before I arrived, was tasked with taking the company's existing sales software and transferring it to a new system using our new partner Salesforce. Working on a brand new team with brand new software was a major challenge, but by the end of my term (which co-incidentally coincided with the end of the first phase of the project) our team had become efficient and were working well together.</p>
    <h3>Goals at the Co-operators</h3>
    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Goal</th>
          <th scope="col">New or Enhanced Concepts and Tools Worked With</th>
          <th scope="col">Outcome</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Experience an actual development environment at an established experienced company</th>
          <td>While working at the Co-Operators, I had my first in-field experience with Pair Programming and learned to use a suite of enterprise development software including Confluence and Bitbucket to efficiently and reliably write and push code for our project, which was a new system we were developing on the Salesforce CRM software. This work term ended up being a bit different, as the team I was assigned to was moved onto the new Salesforce project right before I joined the team, meaning many concepts were just as new for other established members of the team as they were for me. </td>
          <td>I gained an incredibly large amount of information during my time working at the Co-Operators as to how an actual large-scale business operates. Over time, despite the new direction the team took, I believe I was able to gain a great understanding of the development system at the Co-Operators and was able to productively achieve my goal.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Gain in-field experience working with the Agile Software Development Methodology</th>
          <td>I'd extensively studied the Agile Method through my Software Engineering courses at the University of Guelph, but this was my first opportunity to take those ideas and put them into practice. At the Co-Operators, we used Agile extensively, from the planning of Sprints, to daily Standups, to assigning and scoping of Stories. I was required to put my problem solving abilities into action to take stories which were assigned to me and in turn produce functional code.</td>
          <td>My skills dealing with the Agile Methodology are vastly more defined now than they were before this Work Term. I progressed from only understanding Agile in theory to applying those concepts and honing my social and reading skills as well as problem solving abilities. In future Co-ops, I'd possibly like to try other contemporary methodologies to gain a wider portfolio of understanding but I now feel that I know agile well enough to feel comfortable anywhere that uses it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Refine my team communication skills to deliver higher quality professional work than I ever have before</th>
          <td>The Co-Operators fosters a highly social, open environment among its developers. As such, I spent a large amount of time at the job working on my communication and social skills, particularly through conversations regarding the details upcoming assignments and gaining advice from my senior coworkers as how to best approach these assignments.</td>
          <td>As a result of this open environment, I believe I was able to deliver continuously higher quality work. Our team had a biweekly survey that we could fill out regarding our coworkers, which would be delivered anonymously to them to provide feedback on what we felt they were doing better or worse than previously. I noticed a continuously upward trend in my survey feedback from my coworkers, which I believe indicates that my communication skills were honed further and further as the term went on.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p class="lead">I couldn't have asked for a more incredible first work term. My teammates at the Co-operators were wonderful, patient, and willing to take on anything that came our way, which reflected on the placement as a whole and made the entire experience an exciting and energizing first run into the world of Software Engineering. I hope that my future terms will be as challenging and constructive as the first, and I'm proud to say that I got my start at the Co-operators.</p>
